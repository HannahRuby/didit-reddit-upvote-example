## Upvote

Upvote is a Reddit-esque web application that allows users to create posts, upvote and downvote posts, and comment on posts in a multi-threaded, nested list.

The project is built using Next.js with the /app router and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and uses [Auth.js (formerly Next Auth)](https://authjs.dev/) for user authentication. The data is stored in a Postgres database, which is created and accessed with raw SQL queries using the `pg` package.

The project is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## Setup instructions

1. Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   AUTH_SECRET=<b4e2ec665755d52a0f6011e2b79cfa20bfb75392>
   AUTH_GITHUB_ID=Iv23lidu2DNxQIYFUtVp
   AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=b4e2ec665755d52a0f6011e2b79cfa20bfb75392
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres.ftzhrrrsbecpxlseeejv:DDcxW9KyLFbu8vDZ@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres

4. Create the database schema by running the SQL commands in `schema.sql` in your database (eg. by running the commands in Supabase Query Editor)
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site
